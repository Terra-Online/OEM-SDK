# Internal Canvas renderer

This directory mirrors Atlos `mapCore/canvas`; only `canvasMarkerStyle.ts` adapts the official CSS class names. These modules are implementation details, not a public rendering or styling API.

- `markerViewport`: Leaflet membership and semantic event nodes.
- `canvasMarkerSurface`: scene lifecycle, hit testing, visibility, display density and drawing coordination.
- `canvasMarkerPaint`: official artwork, typography and cached raster sprites. Sprite density is independent of viewport density; small sprites use at least 2× sampling, while the viewport keeps the actual display DPR.
- `canvasSpriteBatch`: instanced GPU composition of those sprites, with Canvas2D fallback owned by the surface.
- `canvasMarkerMotion`: shared animation channels without shared mutable marker state.
- `clusterGroup`, `spatialClusters`, `canvasMarkerCluster`: spatial grouping and expansion to authored positions.

Keep matching renderer changes synchronized between repositories. Display changes invalidate cached poses without replacing marker identities or restarting animation channels.
